# Mars Rover Picture Downloader by Sin

Created this fun little program that can download a series of MARS images from NASA's public API.

# The Program Features

  - An ability to read in a text file that contains the dates of the MARS images to download.
  - The dates in the file can be in various formats, as long as it is a valid date.
  - Files are stored C:\Temp\ and a Results.html file is generated.
  - Once all the images have been download, the browser will launch and load Results.html displaying all the images that were successfully downloaded.

# Areas that Can Be Improved On

  - Hard-coded or configurable values could be read-in as a config file.
  - We could use more unit testing.
  - We could use more advance logging either to a text file or to a databse.
  - We could have stored the images into a database.
  - Better code design / architecture to better adhere to the SOLID principle.
  - Performance metrics.

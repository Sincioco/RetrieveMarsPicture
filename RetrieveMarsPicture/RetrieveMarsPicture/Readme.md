# Mars Rover Picture Downloader by Sin

Created this fun little program that can download a series of MARS images from NASA's public API.

# The Program Features

  - An ability to read in a text file that contains the dates of the MARS images to download.
  - The dates in the file can be in various formats, as long as it is a valid date.
  - We won't re-down images we have already downloaded.
  - Files are stored (hard coded) in C:\Temp\, and a Results.html file is generated.
  - Once all the images have been download, the browser will launch and load Results.html.

# Areas that Can Be Improved On

  - Configurable values could be read-in as a config file.
  - We could use more unit testing.
  - We could use more advance logging either to a text file or to a databse.
  - We could have stored the images into a database.
